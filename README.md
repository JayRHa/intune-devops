## What is this?

Intune DevOps supports Microsoft Intune and endpoint management workflows such as automation, troubleshooting, remediation, deployment, or reporting.

## Project Context

- Use it when Intune work should be scripted, packaged, synchronized, or made easier to repeat.
- Most workflows start from repository assets, then move through Microsoft Graph, Intune, or device-side execution.
- This repository is maintained as a practical project and reference asset.

## How It Works

The repository stores scripts or tooling, administrators configure or run them, Intune and Microsoft Graph apply the work, and endpoint results feed back into reports or follow-up actions.
